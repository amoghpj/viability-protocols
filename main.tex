\section{Foreword}
We are receiving 60 distinct samples, with 2 replicates from NIST. These samples are 10 mL blood which are potentially frozen, and potentially not frozen. Each sample has between 0 and 3 organisms, which are a combination of fungi, viruses, and bacteria. We need to store the sample in 2 CONOPS (doubling treatment plates). The Cell Viability Core (CVC) are potentially unblinded to the samples. The treatment teams (Silver \& Marelli) are blinded to the samples to avoid preferential treatment. We need to report for each sample what was in it, how much, and how much survived after 7 days.

All samples need to be treated as BSL2+. All well plates need to have lids at all times. All handling of samples need to be done in the Tecan (sealed) or in a bio-safety cabinet. All biosafety bags which handle BSL2+ samples need to be sprayed down before placing in normal biosafety containers, including that from the Tecan. \amogh{I was forgetting some of the common sense safety stuff you probably know when converting from BSC best practices to Tecan best practices, perhaps it would be good to write them down}

\section{Protocols}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Media prep (\Cref{sec:media-prep})
    \item Cell culture calculations
    \item Tecan startup (\Cref{sec:tecan-start})
    \item Tecan shutdown (\Cref{sec:tecan-shut})
    \item Protocol - Bacterial, fungal serial dilutions (Method: \texttt{Serial Dilutions - Bacterial/Fungal})

    \item Protocol - Viral serial dilutions
    \item Protocol - qPCR setup for bacteria/fungi (Method: \texttt{384 well plates read})
    \item Protocol - qPCR setup for virus (Method: \texttt{384 well plates read})
    \item Protocol - OD reads (Method: \texttt{384 well plates read})
    \item Treatment Preparation and Conditions \bradley{}
    \item Handling of samples with hyphal fungi \colin{} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item receive 60 samples (4 ml of blood in ORIGINAL 10 ML TUBES) handed to him by Amogh/Bradley
        \item Vortex ORIGINAL tubes, 1-2 at a time, for 4 rounds, 34 seconds each. (The breaks in between rounds are for Colin's poor fingers to rest). \textbf{[10 mins]}
        \item Transfer vortexed tubes to 5 tube racks (12 tubes per rack).
        \item Place first rack in bath sonicator. Make sure water is up to "fill" level.
        \item Turn on bath sonicator for 10 minutes. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Repeat for all 5 racks. \textbf{[1 h 15 mins]}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Look for breakage of fungus ball clumps. If you're not seeing anything, possibly repeat certain samples.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Grab pre-prepared \zeina{plan to hand colin these labeled tubes} 5 ml tubes, clean, labeled 1-60, and put 100 um cell strainer on top
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  (make sure the width of the cell strainer is compatible with the 5 ml tubes not the 50 mls!!)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Pour or use serological pipette \colin{decide which one} to filter the 60 sonicated samples into the clean 5 ml labeled tubes. 
    \item For any remaining very large fungal balls stuck in filter, we would like to save them just in case. That way we are able to qPCR to identify the strain. \zeina{prepare a rack of 50 ml conicals on standby (ulabeled) just in case}
    \item \amogh{do we now need to give you a plate of fungus so it can be TECAN ready? + how do we transfer them? + can we make a plate map for this?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Media prep}
\label{sec:media-prep}
\begin{description}
\item[Universal bacterial media (UBM)] TSB+BHI supplemented with NAD and Hemin. TSB - Mix 30g TSB powder into 1L media, autoclave. BHI - mix 37g BHI powder into 1L media, autoclave. 2000X Hemin and NAD stocks are stored in the -80 in GOLD513.
\item[Fungal media] Potato Dextrose Broth.
\item[Cell culture media for Vero cells] EMEM + 10\% FBS. We use 200uL per well, each 96 well plate needs 20mL of cells resuspended in media.
\end{description}

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Tecan startup}
\label{sec:tecan-start}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Turn Tecan power on. The power switch is located on the white box next to the computer below the deck.
\item Start FluentControl, the Tecan software. This can take 3-5 minutes. Acknowledge the warning that the software is not meant of clinical use.
\item Ensure the deck is cleared of any old tip boxes, tip box lids, plates, stray pipette tips etc.
\item Examine the RGA, the robotic arm fingers
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Pull down the RGA until it is flat against one of the plate nests. Ensure the fingers are both horizontal. If not, align the fingers.
  \item Firmly but slowly move the fingers up and down to ensure the screw is tight. If the finger is pivoting in the z-direction, tighten the screw at the base of the finger using the TORX15 or TORX20 screw driver.
  \item Spray deck with 70\% ethanol, wipe down.
  \item Place bioharzard bag in the waste chute.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Treatments} \label{treatments}
A total of 10 treatments will be prepared and applied to all 60 samples on  \ref{day0instructions}, the treatment conditions have been decided as follows. The following calculations assume we are doing 2 treatment replicates that go into dilutions. We expect 1e6 cells/mL or 1e4 cells/well. We will perform 6x 10-fold serial dilutions to account for carryover. See \ref{tab:dilution-plan-day-0} for a reference of the treatments and how many plates, and dilution plates are required. For the preparation of solutions, double the treatment per each organism type, and each treatment type. For treatment plates, each plate will have 36 microliters of treatment, to which 14 microliters of sample will be placed, or a 1/3 dilution. This has been verified for blood work.
